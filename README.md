![mod logo slash icon](https://github.com/nixthatoneartist/NixDeckSkins1/blob/c9b1e3899eb94fb37dcc4f969a6924dadf28460a/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20113107.png)

...okay I'll grant some of the ones I did here are obscure, but also DELTARUNE CHAPTER 4 SKIN WOAH IS THAT MIKE DELTARUNE

tl;dr yeah, this is a set of deck skins i made while i've been working on another mod of mine, so feel free to download... or not

in any case, some Fun Facts™
1. Yes, I made Low and High Contrast Versions of both sets. Check it:

   ![low contrast example](https://github.com/nixthatoneartist/NixDeckSkins1/blob/07fdbb6bb9701a17d4c111f319c09b2c1ff87c1d/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20112722.png)
   ![high contrast example](https://github.com/nixthatoneartist/NixDeckSkins1/blob/07fdbb6bb9701a17d4c111f319c09b2c1ff87c1d/Screenshot%202025-07-13%20112753.png)
2. In the case that you're curious about the names of those in this image that isn't one of the Mikes in the Club set, going down the list (again, skipping Clubs):
   - Memon, the Meme Demon
   - EROS, Hand of Order
   - Lilith, Memon's Sister
   - Dee F. Alt
   - King Frederick
   - actually idk if this one has a name
   - Nyel, Crystal Demon
   - 06
   - Guymba
   - Nekke
4. No, the boogieman will NOT find you in twenty days, idk what Jerry was on with that message we had to delete from the README earlier.
5. This concludes Fun Facts™

## HOW TO INSTALL
just make sure steammodded and lovely are updated as they should, and you can unzip the 'NixDeckSkins1' folder in your mods folder

(or if you're having trouble finding said folder, the path should be %appdata% > "Balatro" > "Mods")

###### (idk how it works if you unzip the whole thing, readme and all, so to be safe maybe just unzip the zip file in here instead but if it works lmk LOL)

## CREDITS
- I made most of the assets, unless a credit below this says otherwise
- all the characters in the hearts suit are by .king_freddy
- the characters in the clubs suit are by toby fox and the rest of the deltarune crew in regards to ch4
- the characters in the diamonds suit, from jack to king, are by ashurii.xyz, guymbagoomba/jade, and chase2006, respectively

hopefully everything should work, but lmk if there's any problems on my bsky, i use the same handle of @nixthatoneartist

thank you tho, ive got a serious mod cooking atm but this is my first time releasing anything so enjoy :3
